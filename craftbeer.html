				<h1>  Goose Island Brewery Co. <a class= 'headerlink' href="http://www.gooseisland.com/age-gate" target="_blank">(Website Link)</a>  </h1>

				<p>Goose Island Brewery is a brewery in Chicago, Illinois, that began as a single brewpub opened in 1988 in Lincoln Park, Chicago, and named after a nearby island. The larger brewery opened in 1995, and a second brewpub, in Wrigleyville, in 1999. In 2011, Goose Island was sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev. Their beers are distributed across the United States and the United Kingdom,[4] after a stake of the company was sold to Widmer Brothers Brewery in 2006, and the brewery was able to expand into different markets.[5] The brewer began distributing Matilda west of the Rockies in March 2010.[6][7] Goose Island outsources the production of some of its beers. Honker's Ale and IPA sold on the east coast is now brewed under contract in New Hampshire. Greg Hall stepped down as brewmaster with the AB InBev purchase in 2011.</p>

				<h1>  Off Color Beer Co. <a class= 'headerlink' href="http://www.offcolorbrewing.com">(Website Link)</a>  </h1>
				<p>Off Color Brewing is an American craft beer brewery in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The brewery began in early 2013 as a partnership between John Laffler, formerly with Goose Island Brewery, and Dave Bleitner, formerly with Two Brothers Brewing. The modus operandi of Off Color's founders when they began operation was to focus on brewing forgotten styles of beer, particularly those made in Germany before Reinheitsgebot (i.e. the Bavarian Purity Law) was proclaimed in the late 15th century, effectively condemning myriad styles of beer not made solely with barley, water and hops.</p>
